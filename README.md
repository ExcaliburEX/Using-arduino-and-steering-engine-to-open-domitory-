## Using Arduino and steering engine to open domitory's door







 This idea came to my mind when I had to open the door because
 I am the closest to the door.So I want to doing something to make it 
 convinced to open the door.After that I had an idea about using the 
 bluetooth and keypad to open the door.This repository
 possesses the code about the arduino but without the devices.
 
## Description
 It's about this device how to work.I have designed two ways to control the steering engine to open the door by the Arduino.One of them is sending the message to Arduino and then it trigger the steering engine to rotate 180 degrees and then reverses 180 degrees automatically.Anthor is to entry the combination through the keypad and the Arduino judge right or no.
 
 
## The APP which controls the bluetooth 
 you can download it at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qYKxLog
 
## About the battery
5v portable source for Arduino and 2600Mah,4.8v TJC for steering engine.
